Defining functions for interacting with the counter:

inc() increases the value of x by 1.
dec() decreases the value of x by 1.
rest() resets the counter to 0.

Manipulating HTML elements:
i was used document.getElementById("disply-counting") to get an HTML element by its ID, allowing me to modify its content using JavaScript.

Updating the interface:
The updateLabel() function updates the content of the disply-counting element based on the current value of x.
